    ## How to build and run the code?
    In order to build the code, git clone
    [this](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) link to a
    directory in your computer. You have to have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) installed on your system. After doing that, choose open from the Android Studio's panel and choose the folder named [Postory](https://github.com/bounswe/2021SpringGroup9/tree/master/postory/android/Postory) , inside the postory/android folder. Android Studio will take care of all the dependencies for you. You may get an error saying SDK location not specified or something like that. In that case, create a file named local.properties inside the root folder (Postory). Inside that file, specify the Android SDK that is already installed by the Android Studio installer in the following form:

    ```
    sdk.dir = /Users/melihozcan/Library/Android/sdk
    
    ```
    You can get the location to the Android SDK by clicking the search button on
    the top right of Android Studio and searching for "SDK Manager" On the panel,
    you will see the location of the Android SDK location. 
    
    After that, it will build the project and you can run your app by following 
    [this](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app) link.
